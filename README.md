# About the Project
## Project Description
    I took on the role of a data driven devoloper, being tasked with implementing a real world data driven web application.
    I could use an API of my choice for the data that had to be collected. I needed to focus this term on research, analysis, implementation and visualisation of the API of my choice. The project needed to use charts.js to display the data on different charts and it also needed to use React to create the framework of the front end of the website.

## Built with
    React - Open-source front-end JavaScript library
    Charts.js - Open source data visualisation framework
    JS - JavaScript 
    CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
    GitHub - Internet hosting service for software development and version control using GIT
    Visual Studio - Integranted Development Enviroment

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
    You will need to have the react app dowloaded on your device.
    You will also need visual studio code to can use the react app function.

## How to install
### First you need to create a new file for your project and open it in visual studio code

### Then you will need to open your terminal in visual studio by clicking on Terminal

### Then you will need to install the stuff that you want to use namely like these
* npx create-react app (yourname) - *this is to instaal react app*
* npm i react-router-dom *To activate react routing*
* npm i axios *To be able to make a API connection*
* npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap *to be able to use bootsrap functions*
* npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js *to be able to use diffrent charts on your website*
* npm start *to start your react app*

#### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Features and Functionality
## Landing Dashboard
    I needed to display a summary or breakdown of the chosen dataset. I also should display information like key factors of the research or the chosen dataset. On the dashboard page the user can find more information about the website and the API that is used. The data set is outlined as to explain the type of data that will be used for this web application. On this page there is a carousel that displays a distinct animal visually with some interesting facts. There are also two charts on the page, one chart shows the average litter size of panda species and anoder chart that shows number of species for crocodiles.

## Comparison Page
    I needed to display three charts on this page, where data could be changed by a selection from a dropdown box. The three charts are a Pie, Bar and Radar chart. Based on the selection made three charts will be displayed as to compare two animals with. The Pie chart shows the number of species for the chosen animals. The Bar chart shows the top speed of the two animals chosen. The Radar chart shows the age of weaning, gestation period, life span, sexual maturity, height and weight of the chosen animals. 

## Timeline Page
    I needed to display a timeline chart on this page where the data could be changed by a dropdown box. The timeline page shows the average litter size of the chosen animal on a timeline chart. Five different animals can be chosen.

## Wireframes
    Please use these links to view my wireframes that I created for my three pages that I needed to create for this project. <br>

## Custom UI
    My custom UI element was that I created an interesting background picture to use on my website for the three pages we needed to create. I also included as a UI element a carousel that displays one exstict animal visually and with interesting facts. I also created a custom logo for this website. <br>

# Devolopment Process
## Implementation Process
    The higlight was in researching API's and decinding on which API's to use. Analysing the dataset of my chosen API was also a higlight for me during the development process.
    Some challeges that I faced while doing this project was to display my different characteristics of animals on the 4 charts we needed to have. Another challange was to activate the dropdown box on the compare and timeline page depending on which ever animal you choose.

# Future Implementation
    The current web application developed visualize a animal data set but only specific data elemnts from that data set. For future implementations more data elements can be added to show more meaningful patterns as derived from the data.

# Conclusion
    As can be seen in the demo the website created adhered to the project requirements as requested in the brief. 
    My final website has many functional elements. The wireframes was used to ensure that the look and feel of the created website was done as expected, some screen elements was changed during the development process as I realised certain elements needed to be swapped for better readibility. I used React, Charts.js, JS, CSS and Github during the development process.

# About the Project
## Project Description
    We took on the role of a data driven devolper, whe were tasked with implementing a real world data driven application.
    We could also use an API of our choice for the data. We needed to focuss this term on research, analysis, implementation
    and visualisation of the API of our choice. We also needed to use charts.js to display our data on diffrent charts. We 
    needed to use React to create the framwork of our front end of the website.

## Built with
    React - open-source front-end JavaScript library
    Charts.js - open source data visualisation framework
    GitHub - Internet hosting service
    JS - JavaScript 
    CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

## How to install
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Features and Functionality
## Landing Dashboard
    On the dashboard page the user can find more information about the website and the API that we use.

## Comparison Page
    On the comparison page there are three charts that display properties that you can use to compare two animals with. The Pie chart shows the number of species for the chosen animals. The Bar chart shows . The Radar chart shows.

## Timeline Page
    The timeline page shows the average litter size diffrent animals on a timeline chart.

## Wireframes
    These are my wireframes that I created for my three pages that I needed to create for this project. <br>

## Custom UI
    My custom UI element was that I created a very cool background picture to use on my website fot the three pages we needed to create. <br>

# Conclusion
    As can be seen in the demo our website created adhered to the project requirements as requested in the brief. 
    My final website has a lot of functional elements. The wireframe was used to ensure that the look and feel of the created website was done as expected and we used React, Charts.js, JS, CSS and Github.
